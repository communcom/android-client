## Main

The application is written in compliance with the Clean Architecture principles and using the MVVM architectural pattern.
As the application does not store any data in the local database the logic of the application is based on receiving data from the server. All communications with the server are carried out through the commun4j library, under the hood of which there is interaction with the blockchain.
The application contains several types (flavors) of composing the project: prod, dev and checking, and two options for building (build types): debug, release. The main difference between assemblies is the server address to which all requests go.
